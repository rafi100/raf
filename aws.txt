ec2 container service -----it maintain docker(itis one vm)in devops tools docker is one tool.for docker it provides ec2 container service.
elastic beanstalk-----itis used for automatic app deployment/loadbalance/all it will take automatic.
lambda-----based on code automatically run the services
autoscaling---automatically incrase decrease instances based on elb.
latency-----data accessing time low that is low latency , data accessing time is high that is high latency.
cloudfront-----low latency purpose we will use cloud front.
Amazon glacier-----used for data archiving and long term-backup.it is secure,durable,flexible,integrated,low-cost cloud storage. data/log files we will keep in glacier.

How to repair the Superblock of the file system?
Whenever we want to store the data into the hard disk, if the input/output error occurs then the Superblock of 	the file system may be erased or corrupted. So, we have to restore or repair that Superblock.
	# umount    <file system mount point>	(to unmount the file system)
	# dumpe2fs   </dev/vgname/lvname>  | grep  superblock    (to list the superblocks first primary superblock and  then secondary superblock and so on)
	# e2fsck   -b   <copy and paste the secondary super block from the above list></dev/vgname/lvname>

	(iii)	Check any wrong entries in the cron jobs ie., crontab editor see any reboot scripts are there or not. If found 		remove those entries and reboot the system.
	(iv)	If the above is not resolved, then check the memory (RAM).
	(v)	If  RAM module is not working the system get panic and it may continuously reboots.
	(vi)	 If the RAM module is working then check the RAM size whether the sufficient RAM that requires to run the 		 application is available or not. If not there then increasing the RAM size may be resolve this issue.
	(vii) Check   "/var/log/messages"   file for any messages regarding continuous rebooting.
	(viii) Even though there is a sufficient  RAM may be swap space is not sufficient to run all the services and 			  applications then system get panic and may continuously reboots. If so, then increasing the swap size may 		  resolve this issue
